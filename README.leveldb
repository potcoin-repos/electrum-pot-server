How to run a pruning node with leveldb

Pruning nodes use a lightweight database to store address histories.
Only unspent coins are kept in that database; spent outputs are
pruned.

As of November 2013 all public servers operate this way.
Please see HOWTO.md for more detailled information. The following is a 
short outline:
__________________________________________________________
1. Run potcoind.

Install version 0.8.5 or higher.
There is no need to patch potcoind anymore.
You need to run it with the config option txindex=1 .
If you have not previously done so, you may need to reindex the potcoind blockchain

Note: Even though Electrum's database uses pruning, you cannot use it
with a ultra-pruning potcoind (forthcoming in 0.9 or later).
A full potcoin node is required in order to know for each address 
if it has been used. Pruning occurs only at the level of the Electrum database.

2. Install python-leveldb: 

Starting at Ubuntu 12.10 you can use apt to install leveldb. If you 
rather stay on 12.04 LTS you can use the backport and add 
"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-backports main restricted universe"
to your sources file. Install the package with: 

sudo apt-get install python-leveldb

alternatively build yourself, see
http://code.google.com/p/py-leveldb/ 
and
http://peter-hoffmann.com/2011/installation-leveldb-ubuntu-python.html
make sure you have libtool, automake and pkg-config

__________________________________________________________

3. edit /etc/electrum-pot.conf : 

[server]
backend = leveldb

[leveldb]
path = /path/to/your/database
pruning_limit = 10

______________________________________________________________

4. catch up with the blockchain.

In order to speed up the initial catch_up phase, it is recommended to
locate your database in shared memory:

 path = /run/shm/electrum-pot_db

Once your server has finished catching up, copy your database to disk
and update the path in /etc/electrum-pot.conf

During the catch_up phase, you can interrupt the server with Ctrl-C;
it will safely write the current status in the database and exit.

_________________________________

5. enjoy!

Once the server is synchronized, it will listen to ports, and the
normal way to stop it is to use the 'stop' script. This script will
wait until the database is closed.

Other commands are available: 

./server info   : view connections
./server load   : view the size of the queue


______________________
Troubleshooting:

* if your server or potcoind is killed because it uses too much
memory, configure potcoind to limit the number of connections

* if you see "Too many open files" errors, you may need to increase
your user's File Descriptors limit. For this, see
